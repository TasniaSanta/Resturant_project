# 1. Git
Throughout the journey of building this project, I delved into the world of Git, a powerful tool for managing project versions. Before this project, I was pretty green when it came to Git. But as I dove in, pushed code, pulled changes, and merged branches, I found myself gaining confidence with each commit. Git became my trusty companion, helping me organize my work, collaborate effectively with teammates, and navigate through the twists and turns of development. Moreover, Integrating SonarCloud and GitHub Actions into our workflow has been a game-changer. It's like having a personal assistant to track our project's progress.
